# Automating-Financial-Document-Extraction-with-Snowflake-Document-AI-and-Streamlit-in-Snowflake
This repository demonstrates how to automate document extraction using Snowflake's Document AI and Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS). The example workflow focuses on W2 document processing, showcasing how to upload documents, extract key information using Snowflakeâ€™s Arctic-TILT LLM, and display results within a Streamlit app.

While this guide uses W2 forms as an example, the same approach can be applied to a variety of use cases, such as:

- Processing RFPs to extract key proposal details
- Extracting structured data from receipts for expense tracking
- Parsing legal or compliance documents to identify critical clauses
- This repo includes Streamlit app code, Snowflake SQL scripts, and automation logic to help you build an end-to-end document processing workflow in Snowflake. ðŸš€

Getting Started
- Set up your Snowflake environment
- Deploy the Streamlit in Snowflake app
- Upload and process documents using Document AI
- Extract and analyze key data points

ðŸ“Œ Built with:
- Snowflake Document AI
- Streamlit in Snowflake
- Arctic-TILT (LLM for text extraction)
- Python & Snowpark

ðŸ”— Next Steps: Fork, adapt, and expand this workflow to fit your document processing needs!
